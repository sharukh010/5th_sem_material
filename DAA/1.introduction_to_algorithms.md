# Algorithm: Definition, Properties, Types of Algorithms, Writing an Algorithm

#### Definition of an Algorithm
An **algorithm** is a step-by-step procedure or a set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations. It is a well-defined sequence of instructions that, when executed, leads to the solution of a particular problem.

**Example:**
Think of a recipe for baking a cake. It is a sequence of instructions (steps) that, if followed correctly, will result in a cake.

#### Properties of Algorithms
An algorithm must possess the following properties:

1. **Finiteness**: The algorithm must always terminate after a finite number of steps.
2. **Definiteness**: Each step of the algorithm must be precisely defined; the actions to be carried out must be rigorously and unambiguously specified for each case.
3. **Input**: An algorithm should have zero or more inputs, taken from a specified set of objects.
4. **Output**: An algorithm should produce one or more outputs, which have a specified relation to the inputs.
5. **Effectiveness**: All operations to be performed must be sufficiently basic that they can, in principle, be done exactly and in a finite length of time by a human using pencil and paper.

#### Types of Algorithms
Algorithms can be classified into several types based on their approach and application:

1. **Brute Force Algorithms**:
   - Solve the problem by trying all possible solutions and selecting the best one.
   - **Example**: Linear search, which checks each element in a list until the target element is found.

2. **Divide and Conquer Algorithms**:
   - Break the problem into smaller sub-problems, solve each sub-problem recursively, and then combine the solutions.
   - **Example**: Merge sort and quicksort.

3. **Dynamic Programming Algorithms**:
   - Solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler sub-problems and storing the results of sub-problems to avoid redundant computations.
   - **Example**: Fibonacci sequence, where we store the results of previous computations.

4. **Greedy Algorithms**:
   - Make a series of choices, each of which looks best at the moment, with the hope of finding the global optimum.
   - **Example**: Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph.

5. **Backtracking Algorithms**:
   - Try to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point in time.
   - **Example**: N-Queens problem, where we place queens on a chessboard and backtrack when a conflict arises.

6. **Recursive Algorithms**:
   - Solve the problem by solving smaller instances of the same problem.
   - **Example**: Factorial calculation, where `n! = n * (n-1)!`.

#### Writing an Algorithm
Writing an algorithm involves the following steps:

1. **Define the Problem**: Clearly understand and state the problem.
2. **Decide the Input and Output**: Determine what input is required and what output is expected.
3. **Write the Steps**: Write the steps needed to transform the input into the output.
4. **Ensure Definiteness**: Ensure each step is unambiguous and precise.
5. **Check Finiteness**: Ensure the algorithm will terminate after a finite number of steps.

**Example Algorithm: Find the Maximum Number in a List**

1. **Step 1**: Start.
2. **Step 2**: Initialize `max` to the first element of the list.
3. **Step 3**: For each element in the list, do the following:
   - If the element is greater than `max`, update `max` to this element.
4. **Step 4**: After all elements have been checked, `max` will hold the largest number in the list.
5. **Step 5**: Print `max`.
6. **Step 6**: End.

**Pseudocode for the Above Algorithm**:

```
Algorithm FindMax
  Input: A list of numbers
  Output: The maximum number in the list

  max = list[0]
  for each number in list:
    if number > max:
      max = number
  print max
End Algorithm
```

### Summary
- **Algorithm Definition**: A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem.
- **Properties**: Finiteness, definiteness, input, output, effectiveness.
- **Types**: Brute force, divide and conquer, dynamic programming, greedy, backtracking, recursive.
- **Writing an Algorithm**: Define the problem, decide the input and output, write the steps, ensure definiteness, and check finiteness.

With this detailed explanation, you should have a clear understanding of algorithms and be well-prepared for your descriptive exam.
