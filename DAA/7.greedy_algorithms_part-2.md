### Standard Knapsack Problem

The Standard Knapsack Problem involves maximizing the total profit of items packed into a knapsack with a given weight capacity. Each item has a weight and a profit associated with it. The challenge is to determine which items to include in the knapsack to maximize the total profit without exceeding the weight capacity.

#### Problem Statement

You have a set of items, each with a weight and a profit. You want to maximize the total profit while ensuring that the total weight of the selected items does not exceed the knapsack's capacity.

**Formally**:
- Given:
  - `n` items
  - Each item `i` with weight `w[i]` and profit `p[i]`
  - A knapsack with capacity `W`

- Objective:
  - Maximize the total profit without exceeding the knapsack's weight capacity.

**Dynamic Programming Solution**

**Example**:

Let's say you have 4 items with the following weights and profits:

| Item | Weight | Profit |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1    | 1      | 1      |
| 2    | 2      | 4      |
| 3    | 3      | 6      |
| 4    | 8      | 9      |

And the knapsack capacity is `8`.

To solve this using dynamic programming, create a table where `dp[i][w]` represents the maximum profit achievable with the first `i` items and capacity `w`.

**Code**:
```python
def knapsack(weights, profits, W):
    n = len(weights)
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(W + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for i in range(n + 1):
        for w in range(W + 1):
            if i == 0 or w == 0:
                dp[i][w] = 0
            elif weights[i - 1] <= w:
                dp[i][w] = max(profits[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]], dp[i - 1][w])
            else:
                dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w]
    
    return dp[n][W]

# Example Usage
weights = [1, 2, 3, 8]
profits = [1, 4, 6, 9]
W = 8
print(knapsack(weights, profits, W))  # Output: 12
```

**Explanation**:
- **Initialization**: `dp[i][w]` starts with `0` for `i=0` (no items) or `w=0` (no capacity).
- **Decision**: For each item, decide to either include it (if it fits) or exclude it, choosing the option that maximizes the profit.
- **Result**: The value `dp[n][W]` gives the maximum profit for the full capacity.

### Activity Selection Problem

The Activity Selection Problem involves selecting the maximum number of non-overlapping activities from a set of activities, each defined by a start and end time.

**Example**:

Let's say you have 5 activities with the following start and finish times:

| Activity | Start | Finish |
|----------|-------|--------|
| 1        | 1     | 4      |
| 2        | 3     | 5      |
| 3        | 0     | 6      |
| 4        | 5     | 7      |
| 5        | 8     | 9      |

**Greedy Solution**:

1. **Sort** the activities by their finish times.
2. **Select** activities that start after or when the last selected activity ends.

**Code**:
```python
def activity_selection(start, finish):
    n = len(start)
    selected_activities = []
    
    activities = sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: finish[i])
    
    i = 0
    selected_activities.append(i)
    
    for j in range(1, n):
        if start[activities[j]] >= finish[activities[i]]:
            selected_activities.append(j)
            i = j

    return selected_activities

# Example Usage
start = [1, 3, 0, 5, 8]
finish = [4, 5, 6, 7, 9]
selected = activity_selection(start, finish)
print(selected)  # Output: [0, 1, 3, 4]
```

**Explanation**:
- **Sort**: Activities are sorted by finish time to maximize the number of non-overlapping activities.
- **Select**: Choose activities based on their start time compared to the end time of the last selected activity.

### Huffman Codes

Huffman Coding is used for lossless data compression. It involves creating a binary tree where more frequent characters have shorter codes and less frequent characters have longer codes.

**Example**:

Suppose you have the following characters with their frequencies:

| Character | Frequency |
|-----------|-----------|
| A         | 45        |
| B         | 13        |
| C         | 12        |
| D         | 16        |
| E         | 9         |
| F         | 5         |

**Steps**:
1. **Build a priority queue** of nodes where each node is a character with its frequency.
2. **Construct the Huffman Tree** by repeatedly combining the two nodes with the smallest frequencies.
3. **Generate Codes** by traversing the tree.

**Code**:
```python
import heapq
from collections import defaultdict

class Node:
    def __init__(self, freq, symbol, left=None, right=None):
        self.freq = freq
        self.symbol = symbol
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
        self.huff = ''
        
    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.freq < other.freq

def huffman_code(symbols, frequencies):
    nodes = []
    
    for symbol, frequency in zip(symbols, frequencies):
        heapq.heappush(nodes, Node(frequency, symbol))
    
    while len(nodes) > 1:
        left = heapq.heappop(nodes)
        right = heapq.heappop(nodes)
        
        left.huff = '0'
        right.huff = '1'
        
        new_node = Node(left.freq + right.freq, left.symbol + right.symbol, left, right)
        heapq.heappush(nodes, new_node)
    
    huffman_tree = nodes[0]
    codes = {}
    
    def generate_codes(node, current_code=''):
        if node is None:
            return
        if node.symbol:
            codes[node.symbol] = current_code
        generate_codes(node.left, current_code + '0')
        generate_codes(node.right, current_code + '1')
    
    generate_codes(huffman_tree)
    return codes

# Example Usage
symbols = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']
frequencies = [45, 13, 12, 16, 9, 5]
codes = huffman_code(symbols, frequencies)
print(codes)  # Example output: {'F': '000', 'E': '001', 'C': '010', 'D': '011', 'B': '10', 'A': '11'}
```

**Explanation**:
- **Priority Queue**: Nodes are organized in a priority queue to efficiently get the least frequent nodes.
- **Tree Construction**: Build the Huffman Tree by combining nodes and assigning binary codes.
- **Code Generation**: Traverse the tree to generate the Huffman codes for each character.
