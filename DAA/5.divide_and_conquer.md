### Divide & Conquer Algorithms

**Divide and Conquer** is a powerful algorithm design paradigm based on multi-branched recursion. A divide-and-conquer algorithm works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.

#### Structure of Divide-and-Conquer Algorithms

1. **Divide**: Break the problem into several sub-problems that are smaller instances of the same problem.
2. **Conquer**: Solve the sub-problems recursively. If the sub-problems are small enough, solve them directly.
3. **Combine**: Combine the solutions of the sub-problems to form the solution to the original problem.

### Examples of Divide & Conquer Algorithms

#### 1. Binary Search

**Definition**: Binary Search is a searching algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.

**Pseudo Code**:
```
binarySearch(arr, l, r, x):
    if r >= l:
        mid = l + (r - l) / 2

        if arr[mid] == x:
            return mid

        if arr[mid] > x:
            return binarySearch(arr, l, mid - 1, x)

        return binarySearch(arr, mid + 1, r, x)

    return -1
```

**Analysis**:
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(log n) for recursive implementation, O(1) for iterative implementation.

#### 2. Quick Sort

**Definition**: Quick Sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer approach.

**Pseudo Code**:
```
partition(arr, low, high):
    pivot = arr[high]
    i = low - 1

    for j = low to high - 1:
        if arr[j] < pivot:
            i = i + 1
            swap arr[i] and arr[j]

    swap arr[i + 1] and arr[high]
    return i + 1

quickSort(arr, low, high):
    if low < high:
        pi = partition(arr, low, high)
        quickSort(arr, low, pi - 1)
        quickSort(arr, pi + 1, high)
```

**Analysis**:
- **Best Case Time Complexity**: O(n log n)
- **Average Case Time Complexity**: O(n log n)
- **Worst Case Time Complexity**: O(n²) - This occurs when the smallest or largest element is always chosen as the pivot.
- **Space Complexity**: O(log n)

#### 3. Merge Sort

**Definition**: Merge Sort is a stable, comparison-based, and divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.

**Pseudo Code**:
```
merge(arr, l, m, r):
    n1 = m - l + 1
    n2 = r - m
    L = new array of size n1
    R = new array of size n2

    copy arr[l...m] into L
    copy arr[m+1...r] into R

    i = 0, j = 0, k = l
    while i < n1 and j < n2:
        if L[i] <= R[j]:
            arr[k] = L[i]
            i = i + 1
        else:
            arr[k] = R[j]
            j = j + 1
        k = k + 1

    copy remaining elements of L, if any, into arr
    copy remaining elements of R, if any, into arr

mergeSort(arr, l, r):
    if l < r:
        m = l + (r - l) / 2
        mergeSort(arr, l, m)
        mergeSort(arr, m + 1, r)
        merge(arr, l, m, r)
```

**Analysis**:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) in all cases.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)

#### 4. Strassen Multiplication

**Definition**: Strassen's Algorithm is used for matrix multiplication and is more efficient than the standard matrix multiplication algorithm.

**Pseudo Code**:
```
strassen(A, B):
    divide A and B into submatrices:
        A11, A12, A21, A22
        B11, B12, B21, B22

    compute the following products:
        M1 = (A11 + A22) * (B11 + B22)
        M2 = (A21 + A22) * B11
        M3 = A11 * (B12 - B22)
        M4 = A22 * (B21 - B11)
        M5 = (A11 + A12) * B22
        M6 = (A21 - A11) * (B11 + B12)
        M7 = (A12 - A22) * (B21 + B22)

    calculate the result matrix C:
        C11 = M1 + M4 - M5 + M7
        C12 = M3 + M5
        C21 = M2 + M4
        C22 = M1 - M2 + M3 + M6

    return C
```

**Example Calculation**:

Given matrices A and B:
```
A = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
B = [[5, 6], [7, 8]]
```

Calculate:
```
M1 = (1 + 4)(5 + 8) = 65
M2 = (3 + 4) * 5 = 35
M3 = 1 * (6 - 8) = -2
M4 = 4 * (7 - 5) = 8
M5 = (1 + 2) * 8 = 24
M6 = (3 - 1) * (5 + 6) = 22
M7 = (2 - 4) * (7 + 8) = -30
```

Result matrix C:
```
C = [[19, 22], [43, 50]]
```

**Analysis**:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^log₂7) ≈ O(n^2.81)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n²)

#### 5. Max-Min Problem

**Definition**: The Max-Min problem involves finding both the maximum and minimum elements in an array.

**Pseudo Code**:
```
getMinMax(arr, low, high):
    if low == high:
        return {min: arr[low], max: arr[low]}

    if high == low + 1:
        if arr[low] > arr[high]:
            return {min: arr[high], max: arr[low]}
        else:
            return {min: arr[low], max: arr[high]}

    mid = (low + high) / 2
    mml = getMinMax(arr, low, mid)
    mmr = getMinMax(arr, mid + 1, high)

    return {
        min: min(mml.min, mmr.min),
        max: max(mml.max, mmr.max)
    }
```

**Analysis**:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(log n) for the recursive stack space.
