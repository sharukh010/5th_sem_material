Let's delve into analyzing control statements, loop invariants, the correctness of algorithms, and methods to solve recurrences: substitution method, recursion tree method, and master method.

### Analyzing Control Statements

Control statements in algorithms include conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`) and loops (`for`, `while`). These statements dictate the flow of control in the algorithm and are crucial in determining its behavior and efficiency.

**Example:**
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (arr[i] == target) {
        return i;
    }
}
return -1;
```
In this example, the `for` loop iterates over an array, and the `if` statement checks if the current element is the target. The control statements help manage the flow of checking each element and returning the index if found.

### Loop Invariant

A **loop invariant** is a condition that holds true before and after each iteration of a loop. It is used to prove the correctness of algorithms, particularly those involving loops.

**Example:**
Consider the following loop to find the maximum element in an array:
```cpp
int max = arr[0];
for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    if (arr[i] > max) {
        max = arr[i];
    }
}
```
**Loop Invariant**: At the start of each iteration of the loop, `max` contains the largest element in the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]`.

### Correctness of Algorithms

To prove the correctness of an algorithm, we often use **loop invariants** and **mathematical induction**:

1. **Initialization**: Verify that the loop invariant holds before the first iteration.
2. **Maintenance**: Verify that if the loop invariant holds before an iteration, it also holds after the iteration.
3. **Termination**: Verify that when the loop terminates, the invariant gives us a useful property that helps prove the algorithm's correctness.

### Recurrences

Recurrences are equations or inequalities that describe a function in terms of its value on smaller inputs. They are often used to analyze the time complexity of recursive algorithms.

#### Substitution Method

The **substitution method** involves guessing the form of the solution and then using mathematical induction to prove the guess correct.

**Example:**
Solve the recurrence \( T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n \).
1. **Guess**: \( T(n) = O(n \log n) \).
2. **Induction Hypothesis**: Assume \( T(k) \leq c k \log k \) for all \( k < n \).
3. **Substitution**:
   \[
   T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n \leq 2(c(n/2) \log(n/2)) + n = cn \log(n/2) + n = cn \log n - cn + n = cn \log n - cn + n \leq cn \log n.
   \]
This confirms the guess.

#### Recursion Tree Method

The **recursion tree method** converts the recurrence into a tree where each node represents a sub-problem and its cost.

**Example:**
Solve the recurrence \( T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n \).
1. Draw the tree:
   - Root: \( T(n) \).
   - Level 1: \( 2T(n/2) + n \).
   - Level 2: \( 4T(n/4) + 2n \).
   - Continue until the base case.
2. Sum the costs at each level:
   - Level 0: \( n \).
   - Level 1: \( n \).
   - Level 2: \( n \).
   - Total: \( \log n \) levels, each costing \( n \) => \( O(n \log n) \).

#### Master Method

The **master method** provides a straightforward way to solve recurrences of the form:
\[ T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n) \]
where \( a \geq 1 \) and \( b > 1 \).

Three cases:

1. If \( f(n) = O(n^c) \) where \( c < \log_b a \), then \( T(n) = O(n^{\log_b a}) \).
2. If \( f(n) = O(n^c) \) where \( c = \log_b a \), then \( T(n) = O(n^c \log n) \).
3. If \( f(n) = O(n^c) \) where \( c > \log_b a \), then \( T(n) = O(f(n)) \).

**Example:**
Solve the recurrence \( T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n \).
- Here, \( a = 2 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( f(n) = n \).
- \( \log_b a = \log_2 2 = 1 \).
- \( f(n) = n = O(n^1) \), which matches case 2.
- Thus, \( T(n) = O(n \log n) \).
