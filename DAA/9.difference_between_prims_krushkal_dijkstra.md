Here is a comparison between Prim's, Kruskal's, and Dijkstra's algorithms in tabular form, followed by the pseudo code for each algorithm:

### Comparison Table

| **Aspect**            | **Prim's Algorithm**                                                                 | **Kruskal's Algorithm**                                                                | **Dijkstra's Algorithm**                                                      |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**           | To find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph                                   | To find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph                                     | To find the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices         |
| **Graph Type**        | Works well with dense graphs                                                          | Works well with sparse graphs                                                          | Directed and undirected graphs with non-negative weights                     |
| **Approach**          | Greedy, adds the nearest vertex to the growing MST                                    | Greedy, adds the smallest weight edge that doesn't form a cycle                        | Greedy, always selects the shortest path from the current node               |
| **Data Structure**    | Uses a priority queue (usually implemented as a binary heap)                          | Uses a disjoint-set (union-find) data structure                                        | Uses a priority queue (usually implemented as a binary heap)                 |
| **Edge Selection**    | Always picks the edge with the minimum weight that connects a vertex in the MST       | Always picks the smallest weight edge, regardless of whether it's connected to the MST | Picks the smallest weight edge connected to the current node                 |
| **Cycle Formation**   | Does not form cycles because it only adds the nearest vertex to the MST               | Uses cycle detection to ensure no cycles are formed                                    | Does not check for cycles as it only updates shortest paths                  |
| **Time Complexity**   | O(V^2) for adjacency matrix, O(E log V) for adjacency list with min-heap              | O(E log V) using a min-heap for sorting edges                                          | O(V^2) for adjacency matrix, O(E log V) for adjacency list with min-heap     |
| **Space Complexity**  | O(V + E)                                                                              | O(V + E)                                                                              | O(V + E)                                                                     |
| **Suitable for**      | Dense graphs, where most vertices are connected                                       | Sparse graphs, where most vertices are not connected                                  | Finding the shortest path in graphs, especially with non-negative weights    |
| **Cycle Detection**   | Not required                                                                          | Required (using union-find)                                                            | Not required                                                                 |

### Pseudocode

#### Prim's Algorithm
```plaintext
function Prim(graph, start_vertex):
    let MST = new empty set
    let priority_queue = new min-heap
    let visited = new set
    add (0, start_vertex, None) to priority_queue

    while priority_queue is not empty:
        weight, current_vertex, edge = priority_queue.pop()
        if current_vertex is not in visited:
            visited.add(current_vertex)
            if edge is not None:
                MST.add(edge)
            for neighbor, weight in graph[current_vertex]:
                if neighbor is not in visited:
                    priority_queue.add((weight, neighbor, (current_vertex, neighbor)))

    return MST
```

#### Kruskal's Algorithm
```plaintext
function Kruskal(graph):
    let MST = new empty set
    let edges = all edges in graph sorted by weight
    let disjoint_set = new DisjointSet()
    
    for each vertex in graph:
        disjoint_set.make_set(vertex)
    
    for each edge (u, v, weight) in edges:
        if disjoint_set.find(u) != disjoint_set.find(v):
            disjoint_set.union(u, v)
            MST.add((u, v, weight))
    
    return MST
```

#### Dijkstra's Algorithm
```plaintext
function Dijkstra(graph, start_vertex):
    let distances = new map with default value infinity
    distances[start_vertex] = 0
    let priority_queue = new min-heap
    add (0, start_vertex) to priority_queue

    while priority_queue is not empty:
        current_distance, current_vertex = priority_queue.pop()
        if current_distance > distances[current_vertex]:
            continue
        
        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_vertex]:
            distance = current_distance + weight
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                priority_queue.add((distance, neighbor))

    return distances
```

These pseudocode snippets and the comparison table provide a clear understanding of the differences and use cases for Prim's, Kruskal's, and Dijkstra's algorithms.
