Certainly! Let's dive into three common sorting techniques: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort. We'll discuss how each works, along with their time complexities and other relevant analyses.

### Bubble Sort

#### How It Works

Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

**Algorithm**:
1. Start at the beginning of the list.
2. Compare each pair of adjacent elements.
3. Swap them if they are in the wrong order.
4. Continue until the end of the list.
5. Repeat the process for the rest of the list until no swaps are needed.

**Example**:
```cpp
void bubbleSort(int arr[], int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n-i-1; j++) {
            if (arr[j] > arr[j+1]) {
                std::swap(arr[j], arr[j+1]);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Analysis

- **Best Case Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\) (when the list is already sorted).
- **Worst Case Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\) (when the list is in reverse order).
- **Average Case Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) (in-place sort).
- **Stability**: Yes (does not change the relative order of elements with equal keys).

### Selection Sort

#### How It Works

Selection Sort divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items which is built up from left to right and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items. The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted sublist and swapping it with the leftmost unsorted element.

**Algorithm**:
1. Start with the first element as the minimum.
2. Compare this element with the rest of the list.
3. Swap it with the smallest element found.
4. Move to the next position and repeat until the list is sorted.

**Example**:
```cpp
void selectionSort(int arr[], int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
        int minIdx = i;
        for (int j = i+1; j < n; j++) {
            if (arr[j] < arr[minIdx]) {
                minIdx = j;
            }
        }
        std::swap(arr[minIdx], arr[i]);
    }
}
```

#### Analysis

- **Best Case Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\) (comparison complexity remains the same).
- **Worst Case Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\).
- **Average Case Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) (in-place sort).
- **Stability**: No (relative order of equal keys is not maintained).

### Insertion Sort

#### How It Works

Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort. However, it is simple and efficient for small data sets or nearly sorted data.

**Algorithm**:
1. Start with the second element.
2. Compare it with the elements before it.
3. Insert it into the correct position.
4. Repeat for all elements.

**Example**:
```cpp
void insertionSort(int arr[], int n) {
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        int key = arr[i];
        int j = i - 1;
        while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key) {
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
            j = j - 1;
        }
        arr[j + 1] = key;
    }
}
```

#### Analysis

- **Best Case Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\) (when the list is already sorted).
- **Worst Case Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\) (when the list is in reverse order).
- **Average Case Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) (in-place sort).
- **Stability**: Yes (maintains the relative order of elements with equal keys).

| Algorithm       | Best Case  | Worst Case | Average Case | Space Complexity | Stability |
|-----------------|------------|------------|--------------|------------------|-----------|
| Bubble Sort     | \(O(n)\)   | \(O(n^2)\) | \(O(n^2)\)   | \(O(1)\)         | Yes       |
| Selection Sort  | \(O(n^2)\) | \(O(n^2)\) | \(O(n^2)\)   | \(O(1)\)         | No        |
| Insertion Sort  | \(O(n)\)   | \(O(n^2)\) | \(O(n^2)\)   | \(O(1)\)         | Yes       |

### Example Explanation

Let's illustrate with an example:

**Example Array**: `[64, 25, 12, 22, 11]`

**Bubble Sort**:
1. First pass: [25, 12, 22, 11, 64]
2. Second pass: [12, 22, 11, 25, 64]
3. Third pass: [12, 11, 22, 25, 64]
4. Fourth pass: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]

**Selection Sort**:
1. First step: [11, 25, 12, 22, 64]
2. Second step: [11, 12, 25, 22, 64]
3. Third step: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
4. Fourth step: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]

**Insertion Sort**:
1. First step: [25, 64, 12, 22, 11]
2. Second step: [12, 25, 64, 22, 11]
3. Third step: [12, 22, 25, 64, 11]
4. Fourth step: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]

By understanding these sorting techniques and their analyses, you can determine which is most suitable for your specific use case, especially when considering the size and nature of the data.
