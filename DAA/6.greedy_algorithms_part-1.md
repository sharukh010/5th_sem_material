### Greedy Algorithms

**Introduction**:
Greedy algorithms build up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most immediate benefit. Greedy algorithms are typically used for optimization problems, where the goal is to find the best solution among many feasible ones. A greedy algorithm might not always produce the optimal solution, but it is often simpler and faster than other approaches like dynamic programming.

**Elements of Greedy Strategy**:
1. **Greedy Choice Property**: A global optimum can be arrived at by selecting the local optimum.
2. **Optimal Substructure**: An optimal solution to the problem contains an optimal solution to subproblems.

### Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

A Minimum Spanning Tree of a graph is a subset of its edges that connect all the vertices together, without any cycles, and with the minimum possible total edge weight.

#### 1. Kruskal's Algorithm

**Theory**:
Kruskal's algorithm builds the MST by adding edges in increasing order of weight, ensuring no cycles are formed.

**Steps**:
1. Sort all edges in non-decreasing order of their weight.
2. Pick the smallest edge. Check if it forms a cycle with the spanning-tree formed so far. If a cycle is not formed, include this edge. Else, discard it.
3. Repeat step 2 until there are \(V-1\) edges in the spanning tree (where \(V\) is the number of vertices).

**Illustrative Example**:

Consider the following graph:

```
   1        2
A-----B-----C
|\    |     |
| 3\  | 4   |5
|    \|     |
D-----E-----F
   6      7
```

**Steps**:
1. Sort edges by weight: AE (1), AB (1), BE (2), CE (4), CF (5), DE (6), DF (7).
2. Add AE: {A, E}
3. Add AB: {A, B, E}
4. Add BE: {A, B, E}
5. Add CE: {A, B, C, E}
6. Add CF: {A, B, C, E, F}
7. Skip DE and DF as they would form cycles.

The MST is AE, AB, BE, CE, CF with a total weight of 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 = 13.

**Code**:
```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self, vertices):
        self.V = vertices
        self.graph = []

    def add_edge(self, u, v, w):
        self.graph.append([u, v, w])

    def find(self, parent, i):
        if parent[i] == i:
            return i
        return self.find(parent, parent[i])

    def union(self, parent, rank, x, y):
        root_x = self.find(parent, x)
        root_y = self.find(parent, y)

        if rank[root_x] < rank[root_y]:
            parent[root_x] = root_y
        elif rank[root_x] > rank[root_y]:
            parent[root_y] = root_x
        else:
            parent[root_y] = root_x
            rank[root_x] += 1

    def kruskal_mst(self):
        result = []
        i = 0  # Index variable for sorted edges
        e = 0  # Index variable for result[]

        self.graph = sorted(self.graph, key=lambda item: item[2])

        parent = []
        rank = []

        for node in range(self.V):
            parent.append(node)
            rank.append(0)

        while e < self.V - 1:
            u, v, w = self.graph[i]
            i = i + 1
            x = self.find(parent, u)
            y = self.find(parent, v)

            if x != y:
                e = e + 1
                result.append([u, v, w])
                self.union(parent, rank, x, y)

        for u, v, weight in result:
            print(f"{u} -- {v} == {weight}")

# Example Usage
g = Graph(4)
g.add_edge(0, 1, 10)
g.add_edge(0, 2, 6)
g.add_edge(0, 3, 5)
g.add_edge(1, 3, 15)
g.add_edge(2, 3, 4)

g.kruskal_mst()

```

#### 2. Prim's Algorithm

**Theory**:
Prim's algorithm grows the MST from a starting vertex by adding the cheapest edge from the tree to a vertex outside the tree.

**Steps**:
1. Start with any vertex.
2. Add the smallest edge that connects a vertex in the tree to a vertex outside the tree.
3. Repeat step 2 until all vertices are included in the tree.

**Illustrative Example**:

Consider the same graph:

```
   1        2
A-----B-----C
|\    |     |
| 3\  | 4   |5
|    \|     |
D-----E-----F
   6      7
```

**Steps**:
1. Start with vertex A.
2. Add the smallest edge AE (1).
3. Add the smallest edge AB (1).
4. Add the smallest edge BE (2).
5. Add the smallest edge CE (4).
6. Add the smallest edge CF (5).

The MST is AE, AB, BE, CE, CF with a total weight of 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 = 13.

**Code**:
```python
import sys

class Graph:
    def __init__(self, vertices):
        self.V = vertices
        self.graph = [[0 for column in range(vertices)]
                      for row in range(vertices)]

    def print_mst(self, parent):
        print("Edge \tWeight")
        for i in range(1, self.V):
            print(f"{parent[i]} - {i} \t{self.graph[i][parent[i]]}")

    def min_key(self, key, mst_set):
        min = sys.maxsize
        min_index = None

        for v in range(self.V):
            if key[v] < min and not mst_set[v]:
                min = key[v]
                min_index = v

        return min_index

    def prim_mst(self):
        key = [sys.maxsize] * self.V
        parent = [None] * self.V
        key[0] = 0
        mst_set = [False] * self.V
        parent[0] = -1

        for cout in range(self.V):
            u = self.min_key(key, mst_set)
            mst_set[u] = True

            for v in range(self.V):
                if self.graph[u][v] > 0 and not mst_set[v] and key[v] > self.graph[u][v]:
                    key[v] = self.graph[u][v]
                    parent[v] = u

        self.print_mst(parent)

# Example Usage
g = Graph(5)
g.graph = [[0, 2, 0, 6, 0],
           [2, 0, 3, 8, 5],
           [0, 3, 0, 0, 7],
           [6, 8, 0, 0, 9],
           [0, 5, 7, 9, 0]]

g.prim_mst()

```

#### 3. Dijkstra's Algorithm

**Theory**:
Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from a starting vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph with non-negative weights.

**Steps**:
1. Assign a tentative distance value to every vertex: set it to zero for the initial vertex and to infinity for all other vertices.
2. Set the initial vertex as current.
3. For the current vertex, consider all its neighbors and calculate their tentative distances. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one.
4. Mark the current vertex as visited.
5. If the destination vertex has been marked visited or if the smallest tentative distance among the vertices is infinity, stop.
6. Otherwise, select the unvisited vertex with the smallest tentative distance and set it as the new current vertex. Go back to step 3.

**Illustrative Example**:

Consider the following graph:

```
        10
   A---------B
   | \       |
  6|  1\     |5
   |    \    |
   D-----C   |
       2     |
             |
             E
```

**Steps**:
1. Start with vertex A, set distances: A (0), B (∞), C (∞), D (∞), E (∞).
2. From A, update distances: B (10), C (1), D (6).
3. Choose C as the next vertex, update distances: B (7), D (3), E (6).
4. Choose D, update distances: no change.
5. Choose E, update distances: no change.
6. Choose B

, no update needed.

Shortest paths:
- A to B: 7 (A -> C -> B)
- A to C: 1
- A to D: 6
- A to E: 6 (A -> C -> E)

**Code**:
```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, src):
    V = len(graph)
    dist = [float("inf")] * V
    dist[src] = 0
    pq = [(0, src)]

    while pq:
        d, u = heapq.heappop(pq)

        for neighbor, weight in graph[u]:
            if dist[u] + weight < dist[neighbor]:
                dist[neighbor] = dist[u] + weight
                heapq.heappush(pq, (dist[neighbor], neighbor))

    for i in range(V):
        print(f"Vertex {i} is at distance {dist[i]} from source")

# Example Usage
graph = {
    0: [(1, 10), (2, 1), (3, 6)],
    1: [(4, 5)],
    2: [(3, 2)],
    3: [(4, 1)],
    4: []
}

dijkstra(graph, 0)

```

### Summary

Greedy algorithms are a powerful tool for solving optimization problems. They are characterized by making a series of choices, each of which looks best at the moment. For Minimum Spanning Tree problems, Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms are two popular greedy approaches. For shortest path problems, Dijkstra's algorithm is widely used. Each of these algorithms efficiently solves specific types of graph problems.
